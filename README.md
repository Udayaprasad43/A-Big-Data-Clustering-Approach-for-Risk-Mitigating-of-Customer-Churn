"# A-Big-Data-Clustering-Approach-for-Risk-Mitigating-of-Customer-Churn" 

About

As market competition intensifies, customer churn management is increasingly becoming an important means of competitive advantage for companies. However, when dealing with big data in the industry, existing churn prediction models cannot work very well. The primary objective is on the churn in telecom industries to accurately estimate the customer survival and customer hazard functions to gain the complete knowledge of churn over the customer tenure.Project focuses on analyzing the churn prediction techniques to identify the churn behavior and validate the reasons for customer churn. It summarizes the churn prediction techniques in order to have a deeper understanding of the customer churn and it shows that most accurate churn prediction is given by apriori algorithm so that telecom industries become aware of the needs of high risk customers and enhance their services to overturn the churn decision. we proposed a attribute selection method based on apriori technique, which is called attribute selection method based on frame level apriori According to this algorithm attribute selection problem can be replaced by the pruning question of classifier combination and we structure an indicator system of customer churn. Then a parallel Association rule algorithm is implemented through a Hadoop MapReduce framework. In the case study, the proposed parallel Association rule algorithm enjoys a fast running speed when compared with the other methods. Furthermore, We provide some marketing strategies in accordance with the clustering results, and a simplified marketing activity is simulated to ensure profit maximization. Association rule algorithm is implemented through a Hadoop MapReduce framework for real-time and efficient data analysis.the distributed clustering methods are implemented to address the problem of customer churn.

Initially the problem of customer churn and the benefits of predicting churn in telecom industries aiming to provide companies with effective methods to prevent churning customers in big data era, we first propose Apriori algorithm improves clustering accuracy. Moreover, it decreases the risk of imprecise operations management. Experiment results indicate that Apriori algorithm has stronger clustering semantic strength and predicting the churn accurately. The second contribution is that we modify the earlier Association rule to big data, and implement it with a Map Reduce framework. Thirdly, we solve the customer churn problem in China telecom with big data Apriori and big data Association algorithms. In this case, we use the data to verify the good performance of the proposed big data. Moreover, we hold a simulated marketing campaign to find the potential customers who will be retained with lowest cost. Results show that the marketing simulation is essential to gain maximizing profits for enterprises and the enterprises should pay more attention to the valuable clusters (customers). From this analysis, it can be concluded that the most accurate churn prediction is obtained when utilizing apriori algorithm instead of single algorithms In conclusion, the process of solving customer churn problem in China Telecom has offered novel insights for managers to raise the level of customer churn management in the big data context.
